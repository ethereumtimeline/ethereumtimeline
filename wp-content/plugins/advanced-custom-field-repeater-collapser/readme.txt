Easier sorting for large repeated fields in the Advanced Custom Fields plugin.

== Description ==

The Repeater and Flexible Content Field features make ACF really powerful, but if you have more than a few fields with either, they becomes unwieldy to sort. This plugin collapses each instance of the repeated fields—**only for the "Row" layout**—to allow for easy sorting.

*To help identify each repeater field group when collapsed, the first field of each repeated field group is shown. See the [screenshots](http://wordpress.org/plugins/advanced-custom-field-repeater-collapser/screenshots/) for an example.*

**Want support for the table layout? Sponsor an update!** [Contact me](http://mrwweb.com/contact/) about sponsoring this feature if you're interested.

This plugin began as a [support forum thread](http://support.advancedcustomfields.com/discussion/comment/16239) on the ACF site.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where is the "Collapse Rows" button? I don't see it. =
The plugin only supports the "Row" layout for repeaters.

= Why don't rows collapse? / Why is the row only grayed out? =
To help identify each repeater field group when collapsed, the first field of each repeated field group is shown. See the screenshots for an example.

When possible, use a short field (like a text field or dropdown) as the first row in a repeatable fieldset.

= Can I collapse individual rows? =
Now you can, as of version 1.3.0.

= What exactly is the "Collapse All Rows" button behavior =
With the addition of the ability to collapse single rows, the button now is always in "Collapse" mode unless all rows are collapsed. Then it's "Expand."

== Installation ==

1. Download the plugin.
1. Upload all files to /wp-content/plugins/
1. Activate the plugin on the Plugins page.

== Screenshots ==

1. Even with a few fields per repeater instance, it becomes unwieldy to sort.
2. This plugin collapses all but the rows first field for easy sorting. (Only "Row Layout" fields are supported.)
3. Once collapsed, easily reorder your rows!
4. The plugin supports nested repeaters.
5. Flexible fields too!
6. New in v1.3.0, you can collapse individual fields! (Thanks to Angie Meeker Designs for sponsoring this feature.)
